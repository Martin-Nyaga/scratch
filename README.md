# Scratch
Scratch is a simple stack-based programming language implemented in ruby.

It is the ruby implementation of the language in [this tutorial](http://scratch-lang.notimetoplay.org/]), originally in javascript.

# Usage

## Interactive Mode

You can run the scratch REPL by running `bin/repl` in the folder where
you've cloned the repo. For windows, you might want to do `ruby bin/repl`.

## Language Features

Scratch is a stack based language. The language uses a stack to store data
and runs operations on data from the stack.

At any moment you can print the stack using `pstack`.

### Adding items onto the stack

You can add numbers to the stack simply by entering the number and hitting
enter.
